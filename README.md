# WeBWork Userscript

`webwork.user.js` adds keyboard shortcuts to [WeBWork], a [wonderful][1] "online homework delivery system" used mainly for [college][2] [Calculus][3] [classes][4] which happens to have no keyboard accessibility whatsoever, apart from the standard Tab-until-you-die approach.

It also autofocuses the first field in a problem as soon as it runs.

## Installation

If you have Google Chrome or Opera, just download [webwork.user.js] and accept when they ask if you want to install the extension. If you have Firefox, make sure you have the [Greasemonkey addon] installed first and then download [webwork.user.js], accepting when prompted.
