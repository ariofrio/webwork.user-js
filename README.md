`webwork.user.js` adds keyboard shortcuts to [WeBWork], a [wonderful][1] "online homework delivery system" used mainly for [college][2] [Calculus][3] [classes][4] which happens to have no keyboard accessibility whatsoever, apart from the standard Tab-until-you-die approach.

It also autofocuses the first field in a problem as soon as it runs.
